GrassLight is a coupled model of 2-flow radiative transfer and photosynthesis in submerged plant canopies. The model computes the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient Kd(ÔÅ¨), an apparent optical property (AOP), for an optically homogeneous water column beneath a clear (cloudless) sky from user-provided estimates of sun angle (geographic position and date),  Chl a concentration (a proxy for phytoplankton abundance), total suspended matter (TSM) concentration, and absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM).  No other direct user knowledge of water column inherent optical properties (IOPs include absorption, scattering and beam attenuation coefficients, volume scattering functions, etc.) is required .  GrassLight computes light absorption by the submerged plant canopy from user-supplied information on vertical canopy architecture and leaf optical properties. The diffuse attenuation coefficients for the optically homogeneous water column and vertically defined plant canopy are then used to solve the time independent, unpolarized 2-flow radiative transfer equations to obtain the vertical distribution of upwelling and downwelling irradiance within a plant canopy submerged in plane parallel body of water, and the photosynthesis resulting from light absorption by the geometrically -oriented plant canopy in an aqueous chemical environment defined by CO2SYS.  
	GrassLight 3.2 is provided as an executable application with associated input files required for its execution.  The source code, consisting of the app design and all required functions written entirely in Matlab R2024b are also available for users wishing to compile their own version, or wishing to modify and help improve the model.
